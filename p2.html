The next games in the series, and the last sprite based ones, to be released were Pokemon Black and White,
<br>which released at the same time, and had minor differences, as is standard for the series.
<br>A year later, sequels to these games were released, being Pokemon Black 2 and White 2.
<br>These four games used much more 3D elements than the previous three games.
<br>3D was used for nearly all the environments, with 2D still being used for characters.
<br>There were several areas besides the title screen in these games, however, that used 3D for pokemon models.
<br>The primary example of this would be an area in Pokemon Black 2 and White 2 called the Marine Tube.
<br>This area is an underwater bridge, sort of like something you would see in an aquarium, with pokemon that swim around it in the background.
<br>All 3D pokemon models from these games are shown below.
