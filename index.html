<b>woooooaaaaaaahhhhhh double blog post ???????????????? errrrrrmmmmmmmmmmm, can i get a double blog post alert ???? anyway i just wanted to let it be known that i have no idea if the images ive posted on the past couple posts will stick around or not. i uploaded them to imgur but when i look at the posts on my profile on there nothing comes up. when i posted the most recent one i figured maybe it was because they were hidden, but i looked in my hidden posts and there was nothing htere either. but the image links clearly work because the images are showing up here and all. so i really have no idea whats happening. either i accessed some sort of weird purgatory of the imgur servers where my images are being saved in like the aether between profiles instead of as posts on my own, or theyre just like temporarily up since i started making the post and they will be disappearing in several hours. maybe those are the same thing anyway ! either way if they do disappear ill just reupload them so that the blog isnt missing images. this blog is my lifeblood now id do anything for it its my fuvckin ride or die. so if the images do disappear ill replace them and probably make a blog post about it. ill probably also include a screenshot of how the blog looked when the images were gone in case anyone who didnt catch it while it was like that is curious. theres a good chance that they dont even disappear anyway though. theres also a very good chance they do though. id say its probably 70/70. like 50/50 but with 70s, because i feel like theyre both a 70% likelihood. no idea what that actually means for the timeline and the fifth dimensional beings who can traverse probability or whatever but thats really just a problem for them to figure out not me.

<b>why the fuck do they call apples mealy when their texture is grainy like what the fuck does mealy mean genuinely what ht ehell. its like a meal??? i know that no one actually thinks the texture being all fucking grainy and shitty makes it more of a meal or more filling or whatever. i guess this line of thinking is kinda dumb because its probably meant to refer to like bone meal or whatever, or like oat meal. like how the tecxture of "meals" like those is pretty coarse and grainy. i guess that makes sense but theres some part of me that still wants to be kinda mad about it. theres really nothing to be mad about though. ijm not even mad anymore i just kinda want to be, not really sure why. yeah the image above put me on this line of thought. also horses are weird as hell why are they like that man

<b>listening to stomach book rn this shit slaps. i wish it was easier to find cool music but i kinda just have to wait for people to send cool shit, which is alright i guess because the shit my friends send is almost always really cool but i just wish there was like a site with every song ever that had an actually good way of recommending shit. like spotify is missing a lot of cool shit and its reccomending algorithms suck anyway, but it at least throws a lot of recommendations at you. youtube reccomends cool shit sometimes and has basically every song ever on it, but it jsut doesnt recommend music enough and isnt very good for actually listening to music on. i guess the solution here would be to just dowload songs off of youtube and listen to them but for some reason iphones cant play mp3s and are really weird about it which really sucks. switched over to listening to operation sodasteal while writing this, their music is also really good. but yeah anyway my point is listening to music is hard. i guess the REAL solution would be to jsut not to listen to music but that would suck more and isnt really a solution at all tee bee aitch. maybe i should use soundcloud more their recommendation algorithm shit might be better who knows</b>
