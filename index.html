<b>ALSO meant to include this in the post i just made, but i fixed a problem with the spacing on the menu at the top of the site. the link for the art page was slightly too far because of some weird formatting shit i did, but its fixed now. the top bar is still slightly misaligned on the comic page, but thats just because theres no scroll bar on that page yet since it isnt long enough. once i start/restart the comic and get enough images on there that will be fixed

<b>the new season of monument mythos is really weird. for those of you reading this that dont know its a youtube series thats pretty cool, its like a semi alternate history semi analog horror thing but i really like the first two seasons. not super sure about the direction its story/storytelling style has gone in though. i feel like its gotten worse at telling a coherent story or at least one thats actually possible to latch onto from any sort of human perspective, but at the same time the aesthetics have continued to get harder and harder. although its been semi retconned to be a mostly disconnected project (or maybe always was?) i think the nixonverse videos had the same problem but to a lesser extent. like it was really hard to latch onto anything in the actual story besides just the fact that these events are happening, but along with that the aesthetics get more harsh and that ends up looking cool as hell. i think this correlation could be done on purpose, but thats kinda hard to say at this point, probably will just have to see how season 3 progresses. i like the dubstep in the most recent video though, it makes it feel kinda shitposty but also genuinely creates a harsh and intimidating atmosphere, it kinda reminds me of some of the terraria calamity ost, both are some of the only dubstep that ive heard that actually evoke that feeling and dont just sound kinda silly to me. maybe i should look for more harsh sounding dubstep, might be something i would like, who knows. anyway, the picture here is from the same video, i just think the aesthetics of this go sooo fucking hard. but yeah maybe check out monument mythos if you think youd be interested, its definitely not something a lot of people would like but i think its really cool if its the sort of shit youre into. also the creator of it is like apparently a piece of shit or something but i honestly cant be bothered to care. but yeah very interested to see what direction season 3 goes in from here and if it gets better or will just be kinda disappointing

<b>today i feel absolutely repulsed by like pretty much everything that im super used to. particularly websites and apps i use a lot, ill open youtube and just feel absolutely disgusted by it. its just like god damn i do this shit so often im literally always looking at this shit it just gets soooooo boring. i want to mix things up or like use more various different websites but its so fucking hard to find new shit online. ive complained about this many times before, but the internet is just so centralized around youtube twitter and a few other sites to the point where everything else just fades away. you could probably spent the entirety of your time on the internet on only youtube, twitter, instagram, etc, and never find any cool interesting new shit that really pushes you in a different direction than just the feedback loop of similar content those throw at you. theres this new youtube feature where you can go to a thing that has videos that are "new to you". the point of this is that its supposedly videos outside of what it would usually recommend you, but whenever i check it to see if i can find anything actually interesting 90% of it is things that usually show up in my recommended anyway. its so shit. theres just something that especially today is really bothering me about how samey all of the websites and apps i usually use are and how samey all the content they throw at me is. its worn me down to a snapping point maybe, i dont know. i just know i want to find something actually mentally stimulating and cant right now so im just writing. i think the best course of action for me here would be to make something, and i really want to make a song thats actually original and not just a remix but to be honest i have no idea how. it seems very daunting so its prtobably what i should do, the biggest problem is just that i really have no idea where to start. maybe i should just make another remix or something or start on my comic so that i can get rid of the under construction gif on that page. i mostly just want to make literally anything. the pic im uploading with this post isnt super related, its just a pic that was on a tutorial page for this shitty fucking art software i downloaded like a week ago and i really enjoy the way it looks.

<b>listened to the first of the interviews with terence mckenna from my previous blog post, it was really interesting shit. not as many similarities to time cube as i expected although there are still some surface level similarities i guess. i found it to share a lot more with nick land and ccru shit, its insane in similar ways and also fits in with it in a good number of ways that i might discuss later in this post, or i might forget who knows. the basis of mckenna's time wave theory seems to be that he believes time is not smooth/flat, and cant be measured scientifically or considered to be consistent when doing scientific experiments. theres different zones in time where one thing might happen at one point vs another. like if you flip a coin at a certain time it always wouldve landed on heads and at another zone in time it always wouldve landed on tails. so this part of it at its basis is a complete rejection of probability theory. another important section of the time wave theory is the concept of novelty. novelty is described as "chance taking, exploring, the new, the never before seen", he saw novelty as the opposing force to habit, which he described as "repetition of established patterns, conservation, holding back whats already been achieved". he created a system of ethics based around these two ideas, where anything novel is an ethical good, and anything related to habit is not. he went further than this though which is where most of the cool insane shit comes in eye em oh, and he came up with the idea that the universe inherently cultivates novelty, and that it does so at an exponential rate. the term timewave relates to what he describes as the amount of novelty ebbing and flowing like a wave over the course of the history of the universe. as time progresses spikes in novelty happen more frequently and are larger, like the part of an exponential graph where it flattens. mckenna created a computer program that mapped out the time waves over the course of human history, and he said that each coincided with times of major change in society. he also cites humanity as the beginning of when the most amount of change begins to happen and when novelty starts to increase much more rapidly. the point where the graph of the ebb and flow of novelty completely flattens is what he calls timewave zero (which sounds so fucking cool) and he described it as being a sort of end of the world scenario, but in a way that we don't currently understand. he said that it could take the form of all boundaries between all categories of anything dissolving, making everything one. he predicted this would happen in december of 2012, which he claimed to have calculated before ever hearing about the mayan calendar saying the same thing (if a theory that he later mentioned about concentration on certain numbers affecting numbers or at the very least random numbers in the past is to be taken at face value he could have potentially caused this to be the case or at least could have believed that to be the case but thats kind of unrelated, might talk more about it later). also related to what he thought about timewave zero was his belief in what he called "the transcendental mystery at the end of time". "the transcendental mystery at the end of time" is some sort of godlike entity that he believed was reaching out to the past, and that as we approach timewave zero, we (humanity) become more like it, gaining more of its godlike power, and that when timewave zero happens all of humanity will merge with it. he talks about the internet and virtual reality as ways that humans are coming closer to merging as well as gaining more godlike power. mckenna thought the internet was the greatest novelty ever invented by mankind at the time which i definitely agree with if were going with his framework here. related to the transcendental mystery at the end of time reaching out to the past he talks about how tachyon radiation is being sent back in time which makes more people have paranormal experiences (also this same tachyon radiation being sent back in time from timewave zero is likely what actually caused all novelty and timewave zero itself to happen. this strikes me as some of the most hyperstitional shit ever, and my fucking dumbass brain also drew a comparison between how pretty much any hyperstitional shit works and how pretty much anything that was created paradoxically in homestuck works, which i dont feel like going into right now so i dont know if anyone reading this (if anyone is which if so hi :3) will understand the connection there yet but yeah i kinda lost my train of thought so im just gonna put the end parenthesis here), and that said experiences have increased as timewave zero got closer. he also thinks that these paranormal experiences are related to DMT, either produced within the brain (he believes DMT spike that happen while dreaming give paranormal experiences, as well as one right before death, and sometimes randomly occuring ones) or taken externally to force paranormal experiences. he says that all of the people who have claimed to have been abducted by aliens had a DMT spike, HOWEVER he does not dismiss the notion that what happened to these people wasnt paranormal. he believes that aliens, or the souls of the dead, visit people in the world we live in not through flying saucers or holograms, but by entering the minds of those on psychedelics, and that the creatures people see (especially on DMT) are aliens/souls of the dead. he was really big into psychedelic drugs and thought they are like the greatest shit ever and pretty much the only way to truly trigger a paranormal experience. when talking about his experiences with DMT he specifically mentions creatures he saw that looked like bouncing disco balls that spoke in a language that could only be seen and acted like badly trained rottweilers. some real goofy shit. "we are far more imprisoned by cultural conventions than we are by physical laws". thats a quote from mckenna from the interview which i definitely agree with and im gonna use to shittily but super smoothly transition into rambling about how my brain connected this to my somewhat limited knowledge of ccru bullshit. (IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THAT IS AND/OR ARENT INTERESTED IN READING EVEN SCHIZOPHRENICER BULLSHIT THAN YOU ALREADY HAVE BEEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO SKIP TO THE NEXT TIME I PUT A LARGE AMOUNT OF CAPITALIZED TEXT IN PARENTHESES) so, when asked by a listener on call during the broadcast about how (i think this was the question but i dont actually remember) the structure of certain things is similar and repeats across many objects, mckenna mentions how the structure of an atom and a galaxy is remarkably similar because there is an underlying structure of the universe that encourages novelty. after this he says that the shape of a galaxy is specifically a SPIRAL which is, according to him, because being a spiral is the most novel thing possible. (im not going to provide explanations for any ccru shit here because i dont want to be typing for several more hours) this means that the novelty mckenna has based his entire theory off of is really just the opening of spirals that would otherwise be closed. this can also be seen in mckennas rejection of science and religion being so closed minded and not being open to things like psychedelics. he believes their closed spirals should be open. timewave zero could maybe be seen as a sort of undoing of the effects of the lemurian time war, where all the spirals that were once closed and all the realities that were once fictionalized would open and become one again, or potentially something more like all of humanity being able or made to perceive the full scope of the noumena. alternatively this could expose flaws with mckenna's theory, which heavily relies on math and calculations, which if im not mistaken, are also generally considered a closed spiral. if the method used to come to the conclusion mckenna came to was inaccurate, this would call into question the ethical system he claims exists where novelty is always inherently good. this could also call into question if novelty is even a natural rule of the universe like he believes. the alternative i would propose to this is that novelty could actually be related to capital, and that novelty as we know it was only really created soon after human civilization. not entirely sure what effects this would actually have on the theory since im not super knowledgable about all of this but i feel like it would reframe timewave zero in a much more sinister light, with it possibly being some sort of singularity of capital or AI or something that would occur at the end of all things, as well as causing said end of all things. (OK HERES THE OTHER BIG AMOUNT OF CAPITALIZED TEXT THIS IS WHERE THE CCRU SHIT ENDS HI). the last thing i can think of that i really want to talk about here is the whole point mckenna had about the world ending in 2012. one thing he was super adamant about was that it was definitely 2012; it wasnt just a prediction, it was mathematically proven that the world as we knew it would end then and timewave zero would occur, with infinite novelty overtaking presumably everything. theres a few ways to look at what "actually happened". the first and least fun way to look at it is to just say that obviously mckenna was just wrong and absolutely fucking insane. which like yeah but thats not really the point of the discussion. the other two ways to look at it that ive thought of are more interesting in my opinion. the first way to look at it is through a sort of more subtle understanding of what "the world" actually is. if we assume the world as we know it ending is in and of itself a major change, then it would seem like timewave zero didnt happen, but if we were to instead look at what  "the world" is as more of a ship of theseus sort of thing then we could still say that the world ended in late 2012. that is to say, if we look at the ship of theseus and actually decide like, ok so when we replace the final part, THATS when it stops being the same ship , and then apply it to the world then that could be what happened. like if we say the perameters for what constitutes "the world" were just surpassed then. not in any major way, just a technicality that made the world no longer be "the world", even though from an outside perspective it would be recognizable as pretty much the same thing still. so the other way i thought of to look at this takes a bit less explaining and its just the idea that at the end of 2012 some sort of thing happened that actually transferred reality or maybe preserved the world as we knew it, and we are currently stuck before most of timewave zero actually happened. the best example of this would be the theory people have that since 2012 weve all just been in a virtual reality. its less interesting to me personally but i feel like its also something that could lead to some interesting discussion. thats all i can think of that i have to say on the matter really, i found this shit really interesting and i might listen to more of art bell's interviews with terence mckenna soon, but i also might not because theyre really long and taking notes on this one took me probably 6 hours or so ! anyway thats pretty much it, thank you to anyone who actually read all of this and if you didnt read all of it i definitely dont blame you. in case anyone is interested ill put the full notes i took underneath the images beneath this blog post :3

<b>meant to make a post earlier today but the site was being dumb, had to reconfigure some stuff in github and gandi, but luckily i had help from my friend amy who actually knew what she was doing lmao. so i still cant actually visit this site on my laptop since the university wifi says the connection isnt secure but the connection is definitely now secure and the site should be working literally everywhere else even on public wifi. anyway, earlier i clicked on this video that was a 90s anti drug radio PSA from coast to coast AM, which based on the comments was an overnight radio talk show about paranormal type shit. the poster of the video replied to a reply in a reply chain talking about several interviews on the show between the host, art bell, and a guy named terrence mckenna. one weird part is that unless the comment he was replying to from the person who he replied to was deleted, it seems like he was just replying to a completely unrelated comment, because all of the ones i could see from the user he replied to in that chain were just arguing with people about if smoking weed can be bad for you or not. tangent about that aside, all that the poster of the video really said in his reply was that the interviews are interesting, so i decided to look up one of them, and i started listening to it. still pretty early on into it and its a 3 hour recording so im not sure if itll hold my attention the whole time but it does seem pretty interesting. from what i can tell so far its about this theory called "time waves" that mckenna has about time. not sure what its really about yet but im going to listen to it and possibly the other interviews too to learn more, seems like it could be really interesting shit. based off of the name and the vibes im getting from it it kinda reminds me of the time cube theory which i find to be really interesting. ill probably make another blog post about this stuff later after listening to more so i can sum up some of the information. ill also link the video below and put a pic of the reply from the poster of the video.

<b>just found a folder with midis of every song from pokemon black 2 and white 2 this is the best day ever. i found a foler like this of all the sonmgs from black and white like a year and a half ago but none of those were labelled so going through them to find any particular sonf was a massive pain in the ass. these ones are all labelled and they alsohave everal other file types for each song which is interesting. i guess ill see what the deal with those is. i just really hope that these are actually ripped from the original game and not just shitty recreations of them like mm2wood and those other funny megman 2 midis. although tee bee aitch most of those are pretty decent. also if one of them was as shit as mm2wood it would be absolutely fucking hilarious. id still be kinda disappointed though since im planning on using these to make some music shit. not exactly sure what but ill probably start by just doing the thing where i slap an amen break over one of the songs again even though on the music section of this site i said i would probably not do that for the next song. i do at some point want to try making some higher effort shit, honestly the biggest hurdle in the way is just that fl studio is the hardest program in the world to use.

<b>woooooaaaaaaahhhhhh double blog post ???????????????? errrrrrmmmmmmmmmmm, can i get a double blog post alert ???? anyway i just wanted to let it be known that i have no idea if the images ive posted on the past couple posts will stick around or not. i uploaded them to imgur but when i look at the posts on my profile on there nothing comes up. when i posted the most recent one i figured maybe it was because they were hidden, but i looked in my hidden posts and there was nothing htere either. but the image links clearly work because the images are showing up here and all. so i really have no idea whats happening. either i accessed some sort of weird purgatory of the imgur servers where my images are being saved in like the aether between profiles instead of as posts on my own, or theyre just like temporarily up since i started making the post and they will be disappearing in several hours. maybe those are the same thing anyway ! either way if they do disappear ill just reupload them so that the blog isnt missing images. this blog is my lifeblood now id do anything for it its my fuvckin ride or die. so if the images do disappear ill replace them and probably make a blog post about it. ill probably also include a screenshot of how the blog looked when the images were gone in case anyone who didnt catch it while it was like that is curious. theres a good chance that they dont even disappear anyway though. theres also a very good chance they do though. id say its probably 70/70. like 50/50 but with 70s, because i feel like theyre both a 70% likelihood. no idea what that actually means for the timeline and the fifth dimensional beings who can traverse probability or whatever but thats really just a problem for them to figure out not me.

<b>why the fuck do they call apples mealy when their texture is grainy like what the fuck does mealy mean genuinely what ht ehell. its like a meal??? i know that no one actually thinks the texture being all fucking grainy and shitty makes it more of a meal or more filling or whatever. i guess this line of thinking is kinda dumb because its probably meant to refer to like bone meal or whatever, or like oat meal. like how the tecxture of "meals" like those is pretty coarse and grainy. i guess that makes sense but theres some part of me that still wants to be kinda mad about it. theres really nothing to be mad about though. ijm not even mad anymore i just kinda want to be, not really sure why. yeah the image above put me on this line of thought. also horses are weird as hell why are they like that man

<b>listening to stomach book rn this shit slaps. i wish it was easier to find cool music but i kinda just have to wait for people to send cool shit, which is alright i guess because the shit my friends send is almost always really cool but i just wish there was like a site with every song ever that had an actually good way of recommending shit. like spotify is missing a lot of cool shit and its reccomending algorithms suck anyway, but it at least throws a lot of recommendations at you. youtube reccomends cool shit sometimes and has basically every song ever on it, but it jsut doesnt recommend music enough and isnt very good for actually listening to music on. i guess the solution here would be to just dowload songs off of youtube and listen to them but for some reason iphones cant play mp3s and are really weird about it which really sucks. switched over to listening to operation sodasteal while writing this, their music is also really good. but yeah anyway my point is listening to music is hard. i guess the REAL solution would be to jsut not to listen to music but that would suck more and isnt really a solution at all tee bee aitch. maybe i should use soundcloud more their recommendation algorithm shit might be better who knows</b>
