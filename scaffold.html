My name is Asher, I'm 19 and I like weird things and strange aesthetics. I like making art and music, going to punk shows and raves and stuff, and playing nintendo games. I am going to UCF because I wanted to get a degree to make it easier to get a job. In the future I would like to maybe do commissions for people that want websites with very specialized aesthetics, continue making comics, and get better at making music, which I like doing but am not very good at yet.

An artist that inspires me: <a href="http://masaohf.atspace.com/Links">http://masaohf.atspace.com/Links</a> to an external site.

MasaoHF is mostly known for his cooking channel on youtube, where he experiments with food and pushes the limits of cooking. He has a very interesting personality and I would genuinely love to try to channel some of the type of energy he has in future projects of mine.
